GO_enrichment directory has scripts used in functional enrichment analysis with Gene Ontology.
Genes were first mapped to their corresponding ENTREZ IDS, with each organism annotation package (ann.db) from Bioconductor 3.8. 
Functional enrichment analysis was performed with 'enrichGO()' function from clusterProfile package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html). 

- enrich_tables.R: script for functional enrichment analysis considering:
	- multicellular and yeast exclusive essential orthologs;
	- mouse categories;
	- 30th and 70th percentiles of essential genes;
	- essential genes orthologs exclusive to each organism.
